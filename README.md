# kube-helper (`kh`)

**Plug-and-play container orchestration for a single machine.**

Kubernetes is powerful but heavy: control planes, etcd, YAML sprawl, cloud bills. Docker alone
is simple but imperative: no replicas, no self-healing, no declarative state. `kh` sits in the
middle — it gives you the *useful* parts of Kubernetes (declarative app manifests, replicas,
scaling, aggregated logs, self-healing) on top of the plain Docker Engine you already have on
your laptop or home server. No cluster. No cloud. One binary-style CLI.

## Why

Cloud costs keep pushing developers and small teams back to local infrastructure. What's missing
there is not compute — it's orchestration ergonomics. `kh` is that missing layer for a single
device or server.

## Quick start

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm link            # puts `kh` on your PATH (or use: node dist/cli.js …)
```

## The 60-second tour

Describe an app in one small file:

```yaml
# khapp.yaml
apiVersion: kh/v1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  image: nginx:alpine
  replicas: 2
  ports:
    - container: 80
      host: 8080        # replica 0 → 8080, replica 1 → 8081, ...
```

Then run it like a cluster — on your own machine:

```sh
kh doctor            # is this machine ready?
kh apply             # make reality match khapp.yaml (idempotent)
kh status            # NAME  READY  IMAGE  PORTS  AGE
kh scale web 5       # resize without the YAML file
kh logs web -f       # one live stream, every replica prefixed
kh delete web        # clean teardown
```

Edit the manifest and `kh apply` again: only genuinely changed replicas are replaced. Stopped
replicas restart. Excess replicas are removed. Crashed processes revive via Docker restart
policy. kh never touches containers it didn't create.

Apps find each other by name: every replica joins the shared `kh` network, where
`http://<app>` resolves to that app's replicas (commit 9) — deploy `api` and `db`, and `api`
just connects to `db:5432`.

## Commands

| Command | Status | Description |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `kh --version` | ✅ commit 1 | Print the CLI version |
| `kh doctor` | ✅ commit 2 | Check Docker daemon reachability & machine readiness |
| `kh validate [-f file]` | ✅ commit 3 | Validate an app manifest without touching Docker |
| `kh apply [-f file]` | ✅ commit 4 | Declarative deploy: reconcile containers to the manifest |
| `kh status [app]` (`ps`) | ✅ commit 5 | Overview of all apps, or replica detail for one app |
| `kh scale <app> <n>` | ✅ commit 6 | Scale an app up/down — no manifest file needed |
| `kh logs <app> [-f] [-n N]` | ✅ commit 7 | Aggregated replica-prefixed logs, live with `--follow` |
| `kh delete <app> \| --all` (`rm`) | ✅ commit 8 | Remove an app's containers (only kh-managed ones) |

## How this repo is written

Every feature is one commit, and every commit `N` is documented in
[`docs/commits/commit_N.md`](docs/commits/): what was built, the design decisions behind it, and
how it was verified. Read them in order and you can rebuild the tool from scratch.

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 20
- Docker Engine (Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS, `dockerd` on Linux)
